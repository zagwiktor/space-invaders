# Space Invaders

The project was developed as part of the "Computer Programming" course at my university. The game was created similar to the classic arcade game Space Invaders. The player controls a spaceship cannon moving along the bottom of the screen, which can shoot projectiles towards enemies. The goal is to destroy as many enemy ships as possible before they reach the bottom edge of the screen.
